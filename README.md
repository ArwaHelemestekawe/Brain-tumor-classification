# Brain-tumor-classification
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. By training algorithms on annotated images, we aim to accurately identify tumor types such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support radiologists in clinical decision-making.
